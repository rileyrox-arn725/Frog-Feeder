# Frog-Feeder
Quick DIY frog feeder build so we can go camping next week with somewhat peace of mind.

Constraints:
I've got 1 week to bring this from idea to working. This means a quick build with what I've got on hand and what I can ask my friend to 3d print in a day or two.

Idea:
Use a robot arm Arduino kit to control a 3d printed archimedes screw with a stepper motor. 

Objective:
Dispense the right amount of Aquatic Frog Micro Pellets twice a day to feed the two african dwarf frogs my girlfriend got.(~10-12 pellets) 

QoL:
The build should fit onto the feeding hole of the tank and the pellet bottle should screw into the hopper.
